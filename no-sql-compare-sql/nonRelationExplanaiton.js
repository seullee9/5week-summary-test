/*
In relational databases such as SQL, the data are stored in many 'tables' in a
database, and some fields of each table has a connection to another table. This 
is called a 'foreign key.' These tables are conncted in such a way to prevent
flooding one table with too much data. Also, when using SQL syntax,  you must
explicitly mention which fields you are inputting, and therefore having too many
fields in one table makes it harder to query each time.

Unlike SQL, noSQL databases are non relational, and take the form of a 
javascript object. Each 'field' is represented as a key in noSQL and therefore
it is easier to query the fields and input data without having to mention which 
fields will be inputted each time. It is easier to put in data to non-relational
databases because of this reason, but it is also easier to lose data because 
data can be anywhere!

There are pros and cons to each type of database and it is important to know 
what suits my needs :)
